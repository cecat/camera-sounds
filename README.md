# Camera-sounds add-on for Home Assistant
CeC
July 2024


---


Analyze sound characteristics from microphones on remote cameras 
to detect sound types (conversations, music, lawnmower). The add-on
does not keep recordings nor can it detect what is being said - it is
only using a python library (librosa) to extract MFCCs
(Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), which are numerical
characteristics useful for classifying sound type.
This add-on has only been tested on Amcrest
cameras so it's far from proven.

This addon is an interim project just to learn better how to make
addons.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.
